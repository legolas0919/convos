# Convos - Multiuser chat application

Convos is a multiuser chat application that runs in your web browser.

The supported chat protocol is currently IRC, but Convos can be extended to
support other protocols as well.

See [convos.by](http://convos.by) for more details.

The backend is powered by [Mojolicious](http://mojolicious.org), while the
frontend is held together by the progressive JavaScript framework
[Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

# Quick start guide

```bash
curl https://convos.by/install.sh | sh -
./convos/script/convos daemon;
```

That's it! After the two commands above, you can point your browser to
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start chatting.

Note that to register, you need a invitation code. This code is printed to
screen as you start convos:
